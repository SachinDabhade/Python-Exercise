# This is the Practice problem to solve the following problem statement
"""
20 random cards are placed in a row all faces down. A turn consists of taking two adjacent
card where the left 1 is faced up and the right one can be faced up or faced down and flipping
them both. Show that this process can be terminate.(With all the cards facing up)
